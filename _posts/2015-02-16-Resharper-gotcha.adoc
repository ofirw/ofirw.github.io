= Resharper gotcha

== "Clean-Code-oholic"
I love to work with
 Resharper. It's an excellent tool that helps on both productivity and producing clean code. I'm a "clean-code-oholic". It's something that i really care about and invest significant amount of time on it.

== Beware: Convert to '||'
When having  a code like:

[source,C#]
bool b=MustEvaluate1();
if (MustEvaluate2())
   b=true;
   
On the upper example both MustEvaluate functions will get evaluated.
   
Resharper offers to convert this to '||' expression, and the outcome is:
[source,C#]
bool b = MustEvaluate1() || MustEvaluate2(); 

*This is not the same!*

If the left side (MustEvaluate1) returns true, The rigt side will not get evaluated and that might not be what you wanted.

Instead you could convert to the old '|' expression:
[source,C#]
bool b = MustEvaluate1() | MustEvaluate2(); 

This is shorter, readable and inline with the original code.
